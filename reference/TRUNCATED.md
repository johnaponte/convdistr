# Factory for a TRUNCATED distribution object

Returns an TRUNCATED distribution object that limits the values that are
generated by the distribution to be in the limits `p_min, p_max`

## Usage

``` r
new_TRUNCATED(p_distribution, p_min = -Inf, p_max = Inf)
```

## Arguments

- p_distribution:

  An object of class DISTRIBUTION to truncate

- p_min:

  A numeric that set the lower limit of the distribution

- p_max:

  A numeric that set the upper limit of the distribution

## Value

An object of class `DISTRIBUTION`, `p_distribution$distribution`,
`TRUNCATED`

## Note

The expected value of a truncated distribution could be very different
from the expected value of the unrestricted distribution. Be careful as
the `oval` field is not changed and may not represent any more the
expected value of the distribution.

If the distribution is multidimensional, the limits will apply to all
dimensions.
